# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics

1. understanding the format and contents of the DataFrame at a glance
2. understanding the structure of the DataFrame and identifying any missing data
3. drops the rows from the DataFrame df that contain missing values (NaN) and assigns the cleaned DataFrame to a new variable df_cleaned
4. provides an overview of the cleaned data, displays the summary information of the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned, including the column names, data types, and the count of non-null values for each column
5. counts the number of tracks associated with each unique artist in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned and stores the counts in the artist_counts variable
6. counts the number of tracks associated with each unique album in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned and stores the counts in the album_counts variable
7. generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of Spotify stream numbers in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
8. creates a bar plot to display the top 10 artists with the highest track counts from the artist_counts variable
9. creates a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between Spotify stream numbers and YouTube views in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
10. generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of the danceability feature in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
11. analyzing the distribution of numerical features
12. investigating the relationship between numerical features
13. analyzing the distribution of categorical variables

The data and graphs provided is useful for several reasons, including the following:

1. Understanding the format and contents of the DataFrame at a glance.
2. Understanding the structure of the DataFrame and identifying any missing data.
3. Cleaning the DataFrame by dropping rows that contain missing values and assigning the cleaned DataFrame to a new variable.
4. Providing an overview of the cleaned data, including column names, data types, and the count of non-null values for each column.
5. Counting the number of tracks associated with each unique artist in the cleaned DataFrame and storing the counts in a variable.
6. Counting the number of tracks associated with each unique album in the cleaned DataFrame and storing the counts in a variable.
7. Generating a histogram to visualize the distribution of Spotify stream numbers in the cleaned DataFrame.
8. Creating a bar plot to display the top 10 artists with the highest track counts.
9. Creating a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between Spotify stream numbers and YouTube views.
10. Generating a histogram to visualize the distribution of the danceability feature in the cleaned DataFrame.
11. Analyzing the distribution of numerical features, such as energy and loudness, through histograms and box plots.
12. Investigating the relationship between numerical features, such as tempo and energy, through scatter plots and correlation matrices.
13. Analyzing the distribution of categorical variables, such as album types and official video status, through bar plots and pie charts.

These visualizations and analyses provide insights into the characteristics of the data, helping to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

In this context to make predictions and classifications, machine learning algorithms can be applied: Predicting Spotify stream numbers, Classifying song genres, Predicting YouTube views, Recommending similar songs or artists, Predicting music popularity.
