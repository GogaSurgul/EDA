# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics

1. understanding the format and contents of the DataFrame at a glance
2. understanding the structure of the DataFrame and identifying any missing data
3. drops the rows from the DataFrame df that contain missing values (NaN) and assigns the cleaned DataFrame to a new variable df_cleaned
4. provides an overview of the cleaned data, displays the summary information of the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned, including the column names, data types, and the count of non-null values for each column
5. counts the number of tracks associated with each unique artist in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned and stores the counts in the artist_counts variable
6. counts the number of tracks associated with each unique album in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned and stores the counts in the album_counts variable
7. generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of Spotify stream numbers in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
8. creates a bar plot to display the top 10 artists with the highest track counts from the artist_counts variable
9. creates a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between Spotify stream numbers and YouTube views in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
10. generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of the danceability feature in the cleaned DataFrame df_cleaned
11. analyzing the distribution of numerical features
12. investigating the relationship between numerical features
13. analyzing the distribution of categorical variables
